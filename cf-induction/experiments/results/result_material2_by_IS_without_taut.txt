#A: Ration of training examples to be used 
#   from the examples except for the test example 
#   (we test the predictive accuracy with a leave-one-out strategy) 
#B: Dualization time [msec] 
#   (The executing time for computing the bottom theory)
#C: Generalization time [msec]
#   (The executing time for computing a hypothesis with the heuristic search)
#D: Predictive accuracy
#   (If the hypothesis can explain the test example, then D = 100; otherwise 0)
#E: The average of the predictive accuracy among the hypotheses 
#   (This is useful only for using CF-induction with the enumeration mode)
